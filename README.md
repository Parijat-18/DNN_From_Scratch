# DNN From Scratch

Building Neural Network from scratch without
using any end-to-end machine learning framework like
tensorflow, keras or pytorch is key to understand the internal 
workings of a neural network.

This repository covers the implementation of basics of NN like forward
and backward propagation along with activation functions, L2 regularization,
Optimizers(momentum , adam , rmsprop , SGD), normalization, etc. using only numpy.

## Installation


```bash
  pip install numpy
```

```bash
  pip install matplotlib
```
